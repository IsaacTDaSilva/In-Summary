     To be honest my initial reason to why I chose this class as my dlab and to be my vapa is because
         my friends were chosing this class too, and I wanted to be in a dlab with my friends because 
         the classes for intersession are long and I didn't want to be bored and by myself but, I also 
         saw this dlab as an opportunity to branch out into the "tech world" I gues and all in all would
         be a good experience for me to get out of my comfort zone and learn something new.   </p>
