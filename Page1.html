              Coming into this class I had know nothing about coding and had little knowledge of jobs that
              required coding, all I knew is that the games I played  like "Destiny",  "Call of Duty",
              "Mortal Combat", "Final Fantacy" and "Tekken" all needed coding and people like software engeniers 
              to bring those games that I love to life. I also Like to tinker with computer parts and mess around 
              Bios software, I think thats neither here nor there but, that is how I came into the class.
